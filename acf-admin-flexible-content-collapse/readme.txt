Collapse and expand the layout settings in ACF field editor for a better overview and easier sorting of the layouts or moving fields between layouts.

== Description ==

When you create a Flexible Content field with many layouts and a lot of fields, you can quickly lose overview. And if you have ever tried to sort the layouts or move fields between layouts, you know that this can be a difficult undertaking.

This is where **ACF Admin Flexible Content Collapse** comes into play. You can collapse the layouts for a better overview, sorting layouts, or moving fields.

Collapse/expand all layouts with one click or each layout individually. 

In addition, the text links for sorting, adding etc. are replaced by icons.

**This plugin works with the [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) (version 5.5.0 or higher) *AND* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) version 4 (needs the installation of the Flexible Content Field add-on).**
